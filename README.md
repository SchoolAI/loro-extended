# Loro Extended Utilities

This monorepo contains a collection of packages that extend the functionality of the [Loro](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro) CRDT library.

## What is Loro?

[Loro](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro) is a high-performance CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) library that enables real-time collaboration without conflicts. CRDTs allow multiple users to edit the same data simultaneously - changes automatically merge in a consistent way across all peers, even when they're offline.

## Why These Extensions?

While Loro provides powerful low-level CRDT operations, building collaborative applications requires additional abstractions:

- **Simpler APIs**: Writing `doc.getMap("root").setContainer("todos", new LoroList())` is verbose. With our extensions, you can write `d.todos = []`.
- **Document Management**: Syncing CRDTs across peers requires handling network protocols, storage, and peer discovery.
- **Framework Integration**: React and other frameworks need reactive bindings to automatically update UI when documents change.

These packages will soon provide production-ready solutions to these common needs.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start: Building a Collaborative React App

Want to build a real-time collaborative app? With the @loro-extended/react package, it's as simple as:

```tsx
import { useLoroDoc } from "@loro-extended/react";

const [doc, changeDoc, handle] = useLoroDoc<TodoDoc>("document-id");

// Make changes with natural JavaScript syntax
changeDoc((d) => {
  d.todos.push({ id: "1", text: "Build something amazing", done: false });
});

// Your UI automatically updates when any user makes changes!
// <>{doc.todos.map(...)}</>
```

The `useLoroDoc` hook (and accompanying RepoProvider) handles everything:

- âœ… **Automatic synchronization** across all connected users
- âœ… **Offline support** with automatic reconnection and merge
- âœ… **Type-safe** mutations with TypeScript
- âœ… **React-optimized** re-renders only when data changes

This single hook connects all the pieces: `@loro-extended/change` for natural mutations, `@loro-extended/repo` for document management, and network adapters for real-time sync. Check out the [@loro-extended/react package](./packages/react/README.md) to see how easy collaborative apps can be!

## Packages

- **`packages/change`**: A utility that provides a simple, Immer-style `change()` method for mutating Loro documents with an `ExtendedLoroDoc` wrapper that hides internal complexity.

  - [View Package README](./packages/change/README.md)

- **`packages/repo`**: A peer-to-peer document syncing repository with pluggable storage and network adapters. Re-exports all change utilities for convenience.

  - [View Package README](./packages/repo/README.md)

- **`packages/adapters`**: A collection of network and storage adapters including Server-Sent Events for real-time synchronization, IndexedDB for browser storage, and LevelDB for server storage.

  - [View Package README](./packages/adapters/README.md)

- **`packages/react`**: React hooks and utilities for building collaborative applications with automatic synchronization and optimized re-renders.

  - [View Package README](./packages/react/README.md)

- **`examples/todo-app`**: An example implementation of a React + Vite + ExpressJS app demonstrating real-time collaborative editing.

## Architecture

This library uses sophisticated patterns for reliable distributed state management:

- **The Elm Architecture (TEA)**: Pure functional state machines with impure runtime hosts for predictable state transitions
- **Pluggable Adapter System**: Modular storage and network backends for different environments
- **Event-Driven Synchronization**: Robust peer-to-peer protocol with automatic conflict resolution

For detailed architectural information, see:

- [DocHandle State Machine](./packages/repo/src/doc-handle.md) - Document lifecycle management
- [Synchronizer Protocol](./packages/repo/src/synchronizer.md) - Peer-to-peer synchronization details
