# Synchronizer Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the `Synchronizer`, a key component of the `@loro-extended/repo` package responsible for orchestrating document synchronization between peers.

## 1. Core Purpose and Role

The `Synchronizer` implements the high-level, peer-to-peer protocol for document discovery and exchange. While the `NetworkSubsystem` manages the low-level details of sending and receiving messages, the `Synchronizer` defines the *meaning* of those messages and the sequence of interactions required to keep the collection of documents consistent across the network.

Its primary role is to answer the question: "Which peers have which documents, and how do I get the ones I need?"

## 2. Separation of Concerns

The `Synchronizer` is a powerful example of the Single Responsibility Principle and is critical to the conceptual clarity of the entire `repo` architecture. The responsibilities are cleanly divided:

- **`Repo`**: The central orchestrator and public-facing API. It owns all the subsystems and wires them together. It decides *when* to initiate a sync by observing the state of its `DocHandle`s.
- **`DocHandle`**: Manages the state, lifecycle, and data of a **single document**. It is responsible for loading the document from storage or applying sync changes, but it is completely unaware of *how* it gets those changes from the network.
- **`NetworkSubsystem`**: Manages the raw connections to other peers. It knows how to send a message from A to B but has no knowledge of what the message contains or why it's being sent.
- **`Synchronizer`**: This class sits between the `Repo` and the `NetworkSubsystem`. It implements the **synchronization protocol** for the entire collection of documents. It maintains a directory of which peers have which documents and orchestrates the multi-step "dance" of requesting and receiving them.

This separation allows each component to be developed, tested, and understood in isolation. The `DocHandle` doesn't need to know about network protocols, and the `NetworkSubsystem` doesn't need to know about document states.

## 3. Relationship to `Repo` and `DocHandle`

The `Synchronizer` is a servant to the `Repo` and operates on its behalf.

- The `Repo` creates and owns a single `Synchronizer` instance.
- **Events from `Repo` to `Synchronizer`**: The `Repo` informs the `Synchronizer` of key events:
    - `synchronizer.addPeer(peerId)`: When the `NetworkSubsystem` connects to a new peer.
    - `synchronizer.removePeer(peerId)`: When a peer disconnects.
    - `synchronizer.addDocument(documentId)`: When the `Repo` creates or finds a handle for a new document.
- **Events from `Synchronizer` to `Repo`**: The `Synchronizer` emits generic messages that the `Repo` is responsible for sending over the network via the `NetworkSubsystem`. It also delivers sync data back to the appropriate `DocHandle`.

The `Synchronizer` and `DocHandle` are decoupled; they do not interact directly. The `Repo` acts as the intermediary, translating a state change in a `DocHandle` (e.g., "I need this document") into an action for the `Synchronizer` (e.g., "Find this document").

## 4. The "Announce/Request/Sync" Protocol

To ensure robustness in a distributed environment, the `Synchronizer` uses an explicit three-phase protocol:

1.  **Announce**: When a peer comes online or acquires a new document, it broadcasts an `announce-document` message to its peers. This message contains a list of `documentId`s it has available. This serves as a form of service discovery.
2.  **Request**: When a synchronizer needs a document, it first checks its internal directory to see if a peer has announced it.
    - If a peer is known, it sends a direct `request-sync` message to that peer.
    - If no peer is known, it broadcasts the `request-sync` message to all peers.
3.  **Sync**: A peer that receives a `request-sync` for a document it has will respond with a `sync` message containing the full document data. The requesting synchronizer then delivers this data to the waiting `DocHandle` to be processed.

This protocol is more verbose than a simple broadcast-on-change model, but it is fundamentally more resilient. It solves the "late-joiner" problem, ensuring that any peer can eventually acquire any document it needs, regardless of when it came online.

## 5. State Management & The Elm Architecture (TEA)

Like the `DocHandle`, the `Synchronizer` is built using a pure-functional core based on The Elm Architecture.

- **`synchronizer-program.ts`**: This file contains the pure, synchronous `update` function and the `Model` for the synchronizer's state. It declaratively defines how the state should change in response to messages and what side effects (Commands) should occur.
- **`synchronizer.ts`**: This class is the "impure" runtime. It holds the state and executes the `Command`s (e.g., sending network messages, setting timeouts) generated by the pure `update` function.

This architectural pattern makes the complex, stateful logic of the synchronization protocol manageable, testable, and easier to reason about, which was critical to identifying and fixing the bugs in this system.
