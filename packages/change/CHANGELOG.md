# @loro-extended/change

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a80326: Remove use of emptyState and required emptyState params for TypedDoc and useDocument. Instead, you can optionally annotate your Shape schema with `.placeholder()` values if you need a placeholder when the underlying LoroDoc has no value. A placeholder is like a default value, but stops existing as soon as the property is mutated.
- 90f1c84: The `.value` getter on TypedDoc is now optimized for reading--rather than creating a JSON doc, it allows you lightning-fast access to the underlying properties without serializing the entire document. To access JSON like before, use `.toJSON()` instead. Also fixed a bug in the LoroText and LoroCounter types where the empty-state (fallback if not defined in the document) was being ignored due to Loro's behavior where a '.getCounter' or '.getText' initializes values.

### Patch Changes

- 3599dae: Allow Record, MovableList, and List to assign values in draft via square brackets, e.g. list[0] = 1, record["key"] = "value"

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ab2d939: Deprecate InferPlainType<> type helper in favor of Infer<>; fix a type invariance bug with discriminatedUnion

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 26ca4cd: Fix an issue with null-unioned Shapes, where null could be misinterpreted as undefined
- b9da0e9: Prevent empty state in useDocument or TypedDoc where empty state includes invalid state--for example, in `Record` or `List` Shape types. The type system previously implied you could pre-populate a list or record with empty state. This is not the case--empty state is not merged in for shape types that do not have pre-defined keys.
