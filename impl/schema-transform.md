When I wrote @/packages/change/src/change.ts I thought I needed to follow the "Proxy" pattern. The thought was that we needed a `change` function similar to `mutative` library's `create` function. However, as we've developed this library it has become clear that there is a critical distinction between our use case and that of mutative: in mutative's case, the properties of the chained objects are not known in advance, while in the case of our LoroShape schema, we know precisely the shape of the nested structure. This implies that a tidier OOP approach could be used to construct a nested object hierarchy at runtime, using the LoroShape schema as source of truth. No need for the Proxy approach.

Let's write a src/change4.ts file that does what src/change.ts does, but without Proxy classes.

We need a utility function that converts a LoroShape schema into a nested object that can be passed as the "draft" of the `change` mutation callback. The "trick" is that this nested draft is not a LoroDoc nor does it actually wrap any of the Loro containers--in fact, it is simply aware of the original LoroDoc, as well as its own location within the nested hierarchy, and can use the doc's "getByPath" method to look up any container needed, and then forward actions to the appropriate container. 

For example:

```ts
export const schema = LoroShape.doc({
  title: LoroShape.text(),
  list: LoroShape.list(
    LoroShape.map({
      title: z.string(),
      description: LoroShape.text(),
      tags: z.array(z.string()),
      metadata: LoroShape.map({
        timestamp: z.date()
      })
    })
  ),
});
```

This schema should be recursively transformed like a parser into an object that, as `draft` to the `mutation` callback would allow the following example operations:

```ts
const doc = withSchema(new LoroDoc(), schema);
change(doc, (draft) => {
  draft.title.insert(0, "Serious Play");
  draft.list.push({
    title: "Goodman Durnick",
    tags: ["fun", "serious", "trustworthy"],
  });
});
change(doc, (draft) => {
  draft.title = "Wipe out everything"; // assignment can be simulated via LoroText's `update` method which replaces text
  draft.title.insert(0, "Serious Play");
  const goodman = draft.list[0];
  if (goodman) {
    goodman.title = "G. Durnick";
  }
});
```

Something worthy of note is the way in which a POJO object in the `change` function can be used as EITHER a LoroMap OR a POJO object in the above example. This is because the schema disambiguates what should happen: in the LoroMap case, the schema would declare it as a LoroShape.map; in the POJO object case, it would be a z.object. Based on this distinction we can "work backwards" to figure out what the intent of the user is. If the object is a LoroMap, we would call LoroMap's `set(key, value)` method (or `setContainer` if the value is a Loro Container) to assign a value. For POJO object, we would call `o[key] = value`.

We should also include tests that show that POJO objects work (z.object) and the LoroMap objects work with assignment just like POJO objects (e.g. `draft.metadata.title = "Test Title"` is equivalent to `draft.metadata.set("title", "Test Title")`)

An important secondary goal is to write parsimonious, readable, elegant code that adheres to good software engineering practices, and passes the spirit of the tests in @/packages/change/src/change.test.ts (without the operation tracking).

IMPORTANT: Use @/best/loro-abbrev.md as the definitive guide on how Loro works. It is our complete set of official documentation on the LoroDoc and its containers, and includes type signatures for every method that can be called on each container.

Let's not use a functional approach this time. We'll try OOP with classes representing the nodes in our parsed result (draft) nested object.

Let's not leverage the existing stable-loro-doc functionality at all in this implementation.

Let's not collect operations at this time. This is a relic of our attempts to merge mutative and Loro. We can directly apply changes and allow Loro to track operations/changes in the background. Simplify.

We don't need backwards compatibility, as we will be re-writing from scratch. We only need to capture the UX/DX essence of tests--the specifics of how we implement the library can change as long as the simple and elegant experience of using the `change` function is the same.

Here is a report from previous attempts that we can use as reference to guide us towards a correct implementation:

# Technical Summary: Rewriting change.ts with Functional Approach

## Objective

Rewrite `packages/change/src/change.ts` to remove the Proxy pattern and mutative library dependency, replacing it with a functional approach using `Object.create()` for wrapper construction based on LoroShape schema.

## What We Accomplished

### ✅ Successfully Working Components

1. **Basic Container Operations**: Text, Counter, List, and simple Map operations work correctly

   - Text: `draft.title.insert()`, `draft.title.delete()`
   - Counter: `draft.count.increment()`, `draft.count.decrement()`
   - List: `draft.items.push()`, `draft.items.insert()`
   - Simple Map: `draft.metadata.set()`, `draft.metadata.delete()`

2. **Functional Wrapper Architecture**: Successfully implemented wrapper functions using `Object.create()`

   - `createTextWrapper()`, `createCounterWrapper()`, `createListWrapper()`, etc.
   - Each wrapper delegates to the underlying Loro container while maintaining chainable API

3. **Schema-Based Container Creation**: Working `getOrCreateContainer()` function that:

   - Creates top-level containers via `doc.getText()`, `doc.getMap()`, etc.
   - Creates nested containers and properly sets them via `parent.setContainer()`
   - Handles both top-level and nested container paths correctly

4. **Property Getter System**: Successfully implemented lazy property creation using `Object.defineProperty()` with getters

## ❌ Critical Issue: Nested Structure Access

### The Problem

Nested structures like `draft.article.title.insert()` fail because:

- `draft.article` returns a raw `LoroMap` instead of a wrapped version with property accessors
- `draft.article.title` and `draft.article.metadata` are `undefined`

### Root Cause Analysis

Through extensive debugging, we discovered:

1. The property getter for `draft.article` is called correctly
2. `getOrCreateContainer()` returns the correct LoroMap
3. `createContainerWrapper()` is supposedly called but debug logs don't appear
4. The returned "wrapped" container is still a raw LoroMap

**Key Insight**: The `createContainerWrapper()` function appears to not be executing properly, despite being called. This suggests either:

- A silent error/exception in the wrapper creation
- The function is being called but returning the raw container instead of a wrapped one
- There's a caching issue preventing proper wrapper creation

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions That Worked

### 1. Functional Composition Over Proxy

```typescript
// Instead of Proxy traps, use Object.create() delegation
const wrapper = Object.create(container) as LoroText;
wrapper.insert = (index: number, content: string) => {
  container.insert(index, content);
  return wrapper; // Enable chaining
};
```

### 2. Schema-Driven Container Creation

```typescript
function getOrCreateContainer(path: string[], schemaType: string): any {
  if (path.length === 1) {
    // Top-level: doc.getText(key)
  } else {
    // Nested: parent.setContainer(key, new LoroText())
  }
}
```

### 3. Lazy Property Creation

```typescript
Object.defineProperty(result, key, {
  get: () => {
    const container = getOrCreateContainer([key], schemaType)
    return createContainerWrapper(container, schema, ...)
  }
})
```

## 🚨 What Didn't Work

### 1. Complex Type System Integration

- TypeScript errors with container method signatures
- Had to use `any` types and type assertions to bypass complex generic constraints
- Container methods like `pushContainer()`, `setContainer()` have complex return type requirements

### 2. Nested Map Property Access

- The core issue: nested properties on wrapped maps don't work
- `createMapWrapper()` should add property accessors for schema-defined keys, but this isn't functioning

### 3. Operation Tracking Removal

- Successfully removed operation tracking (returns empty `ops` array)
- But tests expect operation tracking, so compatibility is broken

## 🔧 Technical Recommendations for Future Implementation

### 1. Debug the Wrapper Creation Issue

The critical bug is in `createContainerWrapper()` or `createMapWrapper()`. Future developers should:

- Add comprehensive logging to trace exactly what happens in wrapper creation
- Verify that `Object.create()` is working correctly for LoroMap
- Check if there are any silent exceptions or early returns

### 2. Simplify the Type System

- Start with `any` types throughout to get functionality working
- Add proper TypeScript types after core functionality is proven
- Consider creating simpler wrapper interfaces that don't try to match Loro's complex generics

### 3. Focus on Map Wrapper Property Accessors

The key missing piece is making this work:

```typescript
// This should work but doesn't:
draft.article.title.insert(0, "text");
draft.article.metadata.views.increment(1);
```

The `createMapWrapper()` function needs to properly add property accessors that return wrapped nested containers.

### 4. Test-Driven Development Approach

- Start with the simplest nested case: `draft.article.title`
- Get that working before adding more complexity
- Use extensive logging to understand the object creation flow

### 5. Consider Alternative Architectures

If the current approach continues to fail:

- **Option A**: Use a simpler recursive object construction approach
- **Option B**: Create a factory function that builds the entire nested structure upfront
- **Option C**: Use a different delegation pattern (composition over inheritance)

The foundation is solid, but the nested property access issue must be resolved for the approach to be viable.

## Files Created

- `packages/change/src/change2.ts` - New functional implementation
- `packages/change/src/change2.test.ts` - Basic tests for new implementation

The core architecture is sound and 80% of basic functionality works. The remaining 20% (nested structures) is the critical blocker that needs resolution.

You're absolutely right to pause here. Let me reflect on the key lessons learned from this journey that would be valuable for anyone starting a similar project.

## Key Lessons Learned: Building a Functional CRDT Wrapper

### 1. **Start with the Type System, Not the Implementation**

**Mistake**: We jumped into implementation details (Proxy vs Object.create, wrapper functions) before fully understanding the type constraints.

**Lesson**: When working with complex type systems like Zod + CRDT containers, spend significant time upfront understanding:
- How type inference flows through the system
- What the final API should look like from a user perspective
- Where the type boundaries are (Zod types vs runtime values)

**Better Approach**: Write the ideal usage examples first, then work backwards to the type system, then to implementation.

### 2. **Understand the Underlying Library's Mental Model**

**Mistake**: We didn't fully grasp Loro's distinction between "detached" and "attached" containers until deep into debugging.

**Lesson**: CRDT libraries often have subtle but critical concepts:
- Container lifecycle (detached → attached)
- When operations are reflected in document state
- How nested structures are managed

**Better Approach**: Create minimal reproduction tests for the underlying library's behavior before building abstractions on top.

### 3. **Type Inference vs Runtime Behavior Mismatch**

**Mistake**: Our type system suggested `draft.metadata.set("title", ZodString)` when users expect `draft.metadata.set("title", "actual string")`.

**Lesson**: Schema-driven APIs need careful consideration of:
- What types the schema defines vs what values users provide
- How to bridge compile-time schema types with runtime value types
- The difference between validation types and usage types

**Better Approach**: Design the type system to match user expectations, not internal schema representations.

### 4. **Avoid "Any" as a Crutch**

**Mistake**: We used `any` types extensively to "get things working" with the intention to fix later.

**Lesson**: `any` types mask fundamental design problems and make debugging much harder. They often indicate:
- Misunderstanding of the type relationships
- Trying to force incompatible type systems together
- Not having a clear mental model of the data flow

**Better Approach**: Use `unknown` and type guards, or accept that the design needs rethinking rather than papering over with `any`.

### 5. **Functional vs Object-Oriented Impedance Mismatch**

**Mistake**: We tried to create a functional API on top of an inherently object-oriented CRDT system without fully considering the implications.

**Lesson**: When wrapping OOP libraries with functional APIs:
- Object identity and mutation semantics matter
- Method chaining expectations vs functional composition
- State management becomes more complex, not simpler

**Better Approach**: Either embrace the OOP nature or design a truly functional abstraction that doesn't leak the underlying object model.

### 6. **Schema-Driven Development Complexity**

**Mistake**: We underestimated how complex it would be to create runtime objects that match compile-time schema types.

**Lesson**: Schema-driven APIs require:
- Deep understanding of TypeScript's type system
- Careful separation of schema types, inferred types, and runtime types
- Extensive testing of the type inference chain

**Better Approach**: Start with simpler, non-generic versions first to understand the problem space.

### 7. **Testing Strategy Was Backwards**

**Mistake**: We wrote implementation code first, then tests to verify it worked.

**Lesson**: For complex type systems, the tests should drive the design:
- Write the API you want first
- Ensure TypeScript accepts it
- Then implement to make tests pass

**Better Approach**: Test-driven development is especially valuable for library APIs where user experience is paramount.

## Recommendations for Starting Fresh

1. **Begin with a minimal, non-generic implementation** that works for one specific schema
2. **Write extensive tests for the underlying CRDT library** to understand its behavior
3. **Design the ideal user API first** without worrying about implementation
4. **Create a clear separation** between schema types, inferred types, and runtime values
5. **Use TypeScript's type system as a design tool**, not just for safety
6. **Avoid abstractions that fight the underlying library's design**

The core insight is that building schema-driven APIs on top of complex libraries like CRDTs requires deep understanding of both systems and careful design of the interface between them. Rushing to implementation without this understanding leads to the kind of thrashing we experienced.
