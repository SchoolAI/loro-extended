Remove use of emptyState and required emptyState params for TypedDoc and useDocument. Instead, you can optionally annotate your Shape schema with `.placeholder()` values if you need a placeholder when the underlying LoroDoc has no value. A placeholder is like a default value, but stops existing as soon as the property is mutated.
